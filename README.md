# üß† AI Chatbot with Context Management

This Python script demonstrates how to build a memory-aware chatbot using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models. It tracks and saves the entire conversation history to maintain context across sessions ‚Äî simulating more natural, multi-turn dialogue.

---

## üìÑ What It Does

- ‚úÖ Remembers past conversations
- ‚úÖ Summarizes old messages to manage token limits
- ‚úÖ Stores and loads context from a local file (`db.json`)
- ‚úÖ Automatically adds system prompts for consistent behavior

This chatbot is ideal for use cases where continuity of conversation matters ‚Äî such as virtual assistants, helpdesks, or personal AI companions.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Conversation is loaded** from `db.json` if it exists.
2. If the history is long, it **summarizes older messages** into a brief context.
3. The user asks a question.
4. The question is appended to the context.
5. The model responds, and the answer is added to memory.
6. Updated memory is **saved** for future runs.
